# Welcome to Communicate using Markdown!

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add headings, lists, bold, italics, tables, and other stylings. Markdown is widely used in:

- Comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Files with `.md` or `.markdown` extensions
- Sharing text snippets in Gists

## Headers in Markdown

A header is a larger bit of text used at the beginning of a section. There are six levels of headers, from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest).

### Header Examples

```markdown
# This is an `<h1>` header (largest)
## This is an `<h2>` header
### This is an `<h3>` header
#### This is an `<h4>` header
##### This is an `<h5>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header (smallest)



// Example PHP code
echo "Hello, World!";

- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed)
- [ ] Task 3
