# Welcome to Communicate using Markdown! 

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add headings, lists, bold, italics, tables, and other stylings. Markdown is widely used in:

- Comments on issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Files with `.md` or `.markdown` extensions
- Sharing text snippets in Gists

## Headers in Markdown

A header is a larger bit of text used at the beginning of a section. There are six levels of headers, from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest).

### Header Examples

```markdown
# This is an `<h1>` header (largest)
## This is an `<h2>` header
### This is an `<h3>` header
#### This is an `<h4>` header
##### This is an `<h5>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header (smallest)

```php
// Example PHP code
echo "Hello, World!";



1. **Edit the `index.md` file**:
   - Add the PHP code example or any other code snippet you'd like.

2. **Commit your changes**:
   - Use a commit message like "Added code example".

#### Step 4: Make a Task List
To create a task list in Markdown, use the following format:

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1
- [x] Task 2 (completed)
- [ ] Task 3
